# JavaScript Code Challenge

Complete the test files that are missing code. Many of these tests come from actual code that we use at Beatport.

To get started, install the packages with npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the testing suite:

```sh
yarn test
```

Start the resize problem (Its expected to use vanilla JS to solve this):

```sh
yarn start:resize # Listing on PORT 3001
```

Start the react application:

```sh
yarn start # Listing on PORT 3000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Feel free to use Chrome or Firefox, and use all of the latest and greatest features of modern browsers.
