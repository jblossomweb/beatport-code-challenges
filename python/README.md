# Python Code Challenges </>

These challenges require Python 3 and Git to be installed on your machine. Create a git repository and submit answers in commits. Return the entire repo as a zipped file.

Navigate to the `python` directory and install requirements:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
$ py.test
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
$ py.test tests/test_math_class.py
```
